# Junction 2020 Connected - resmeat™
Team Dataatti submission for HK Scan challenge  
Authors: Aleksi Väisänen, Matias Lappalainen and Petro Silenius

## Idea
Our idea is to make responsible choices more fun. With our engaging application called resmeat, consumers are able to further compensate their carbon footprint after choosing responsible local meat. The application name originates from responsible meat.

Consumers scan a QR code from a bought product, which gives them points based on the responsibility and ecofriendliness of the product. After scanning the QR code, the consumer plays a minigame “Spin the Chicken” which is a fun and engaging game.

## Gamification
The minigame allows users to compensate for their products' carbon emissions. HKScan executes the emission compensations that the users have earned. The minigame engages the consumer and makes them want to return to the application after each purchase. The original idea for the minigame was to scale it according to the product emissions so it would demonstrate the environmental impact but this wasn’t feasible due to the schedule.

The total points of the product come from its responsibility factors as well as from the game success. Consumers get points from each product scan and then an average is calculated from these. Players are placed on the leaderboard based on their monthly scores and top players are awarded with - for example - music festival tickets, which excites and brings more young users. The gamification encourages consumers to a more environmentally aware lifestyle and provides a way for them to track their progress as well as compare themselves to others.

## Values
resmeat brings value to both consumers and HKScan. Customers receive important information about the carbon footprint of their choices and compete for monthly prizes. Making more responsible choices gives more points, thus making top of the leaderboard more achievable by responsible consumers. 

HKScan receives information of the users and their shopping history based on the scanned products. resmeat provides information especially from the customers’ interests towards the responsibility of the meat production and their activity in the application. This data can be used to measure HKScan marketing success since successful advertisements about the topic increase the current usage. Let’s make responsible choices fun together!
